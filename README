The goal is to take the news out of your Twitter timeline and make it easy
to read. It's a personalized news reader displaying news that the users
you follow think is interesting.

After logging through Twitter (using Abraham's OAuth library), index.php requests the user's timeline. It looks for any links in the timeline and
if it finds them, it requests the page source of the link. It tries to find
the headline of the story using different meta tags. If it can't find it,
it will use the page's title. We display the headline, user who posted it,
and an option to retweet the story. When the user clicks on a headline,
it opens a lightbox with an iframe in it, showing the story.

Issues:
-Links posted to Twitter are not always news stories (images, videos, etc.)
-Proper headlines aren't found on many sites
-NYTimes doesn't allow their content in an iframe

Improvements:
-Add option to search Twitter instead of pulling from timeline
-Button to how original tweet
-Better layout
-Pull in rss feeds in addition to Twitter
